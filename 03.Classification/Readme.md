Classification Model | Pros | Cons
| :---:| :--: | :---:
Logistic Regression | Probabilistic approach, gives informations about statistical significance of features | The Logistic Regression Assumptions
K-NN | Simple to understand, fast and efficient | Need to choose the number of neighbours k
SVM | Performant, not biased by outliers, not sensitive to overfitting | Not appropriate for non linear problems, not the best choice for large number of features
Kernel SVM | High performance on nonlinear problems, not biased by outliers, not sensitive to overfitting | Not the best choice for large number of features, more complex
Naive Bayes | Efficient, not biased by outliers, works on nonlinear problems, probabilistic approach | Based on the assumption that features have same statistical relevance
Decision Tree Classification | Interpretability, no need for feature scaling, works on both linear / nonlinear problems | Poor results on too small datasets, overfitting can easily occur
Random Forest Classification | Powerful and accurate, good performance on many problems, including non linear | No interpretability, overfitting can easily occur, need to choose the number of trees
